# mdparser-js
This is a simple markdown to HTML converter that reads markdown data and returns
an HTML representation, with support for headers, text emphasis, block quotes,
unordered lists, hr tags and spans, along with normal text as paragraphs. 

It is currently very basic, and is built primarily to be used with MongoDB as
part of my other project, Skalver: https://github.com/oxifinch/skalver

This is a school project, and I cannot guarantee and consistent quality or
development pace, but I have plans to improve it when I have the time, and add
some more support for more advanced markdown syntax.
